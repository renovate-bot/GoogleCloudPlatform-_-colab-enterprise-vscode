## Contribution process

### Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- If using `nvm` (**recommended**): `nvm use` at repo root to set the correct versions of `node` and `npm`.
- If **not** using `nvm`:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) at the version listed in [.nvmrc](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/colab-enterprise-vscode/blob/main/.nvmrc).
  - The matching [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) version (comes bundled with `node`).
- The following extensions:
  - [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
  - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- Configure your environment:
  - Create an OAuth 2.0 _Desktop_ client credentials ([instructions](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)).
  - Make a copy of the environment template: `cp .env.template .env`
  - Set the values in the `.env` file:
    ```txt
    WORKBENCH_EXTENSION_CLIENT_ID=<TODO>
    WORKBENCH_EXTENSION_CLIENT_NOT_SO_SECRET=<TODO>
    ```
  - Execute `npm run generate:config` to generate the required static config.

### Local Development

1. Open the repo root with VS Code.
1. `npm ci` - install dependencies.
1. `npm run generate:config` - generate the required static config. This only needs to be done when changes to `.env` are made.
1. Launch the extension by pressing `F5` or selecting `Run Extension` from VS Code's _Run and Debug_ view.
1. Create or open a Jupyter notebook file (`.ipynb`).
1. Test and validate your changes.

#### Incremental Build

Launching the extension will automatically kick off the `watch:prod` build task. This can be ran without launching during development by [running the build task](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks).

Incremental build output can be found in the _Terminal_ VS Code panel.

TypeScript errors and warnings can be found in the _Problems_ VS Code panel, provided a _typecheck_-ing build is running (see [`package.json`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/colab-enterprise-vscode/blob/main/package.json)).

If you've removed files, you may need to `npm run clean`.

#### Tests

Unit tests must have the extension `.unit.test.ts`. To run them:

```sh
npm run test:unit
npm run test:unit -- --grep='your-regex-filter'
```

Unit tests can be debugged by launching _Debug Unit Tests_. The `"args"` can be modified to filter with the `grep` field as outlined above.

The unit tests rely extensively on a [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) stub of the `vscode` module. `vscode` is the _engine_ the Node app runs under and is not an installable npm package. While this stubbing is terse, it enables the entire unit test suite to run sub-1-second. Please peruse existing tests for reference when authoring new ones.

While there are end-to-end tests, running them requires access to accounts with _automation_ exemptions that only Googlers can use. Pull request automation (once approved by a maintainer) will run them.
